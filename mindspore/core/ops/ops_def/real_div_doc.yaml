real_div:
    description: |
        Divides the first input tensor by the second input tensor in floating-point type element-wise.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.div` for more details.

        .. math::

            out_{i} =  \\frac{input_i}{other_i})

        Args:
            input (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The first input is a number or
                a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
            other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The second input is a number or
                a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
            and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If neither `input` nor `other` is a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.RealDiv()(x, y)
            >>> print(output)
            [0.25 0.4 0.5 ]
