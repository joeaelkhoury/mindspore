zeros_like:
    description: |
        Returns a Tensor with a value of 0 and its shape and data type is the same as the input.

        Args:
            - **input_x** (Tensor) - Input Tensor of any dimension.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and data type as `input_x` but filled with zeros.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input_x` is not a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[0, 1], [2, 1]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> output = ops.ZerosLike()(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [[0. 0.]
             [0. 0.]]
