gcd:
    description: |
        Computes greatest common divisor of input tensors element-wise.
        The shape of two inputs should be broadcastable, and data type of them should be
        one of: int32, int64.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            - **x1** (Tensor) - The first input tensor.
            - **x2** (Tensor) - The second input tensor.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is one
            with higher precision in the two inputs.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If data type `x1` or `x2` is not int32 or int64.
            ValueError: If shape of two inputs are not broadcastable.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x1 = Tensor(np.array([7, 8, 9]))
            >>> x2 = Tensor(np.array([14, 6, 12]))
            >>> y = ops.gcd(x1, x2)
            >>> print(y)
            [7 2 3]
