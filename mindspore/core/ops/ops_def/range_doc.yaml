range:
    description: |
        Creates a sequence of numbers that begins at `start` and extends by increments of
        `delta` up to but not including `limit`.

        The types of all 3 inputs must be all integers or floating-point numbers.

        Args:
            start (number): The first number in the sequence. Must have
                type: int32 ,int64, float32 or float64.
            limit (number): Upper limit of the sequence, exclusive. Must
                have type: int32 ,int64, float32 or float64.
            delta (number): Number that increments `start`. Must have
                type: int32 ,int64, float32 or float64.
            maxlen (int, optional): Memory that can fit `maxlen` many elements
                will be allocated for the output. Optional, must be positive. Default: 1000000.
                If the output has more than `maxlen` elements, a runtime error will occur.

        Returns:
            A 1-D Tensor. If `start`, `limit` and `delta` are all integers, the type of output is int64.
            If `start`, `limit` and `delta` are all floating-point numbers, the type of output is float32.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If 'start', 'limit', 'delta' have both integers and floating-point numbers.
            TypeError: If datatype of `start`, `limit` or `delta` is not supported.
            ValueError: If `delta` = 0.
            ValueError: If `start` >= `limit` when `delta` > 0.
            ValueError: If `start` <= `limit` when `delta` < 0.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> from mindspore import ops
            >>> start = 0
            >>> limit = 10
            >>> delta = 4
            >>> output = ops.range(start, limit, delta)
            >>> print(output)
            [0 4 8]
