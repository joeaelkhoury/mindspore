eye:
  description: |
    Creates a tensor with ones on the diagonal and zeros in the rest.

    Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.eye` for more details.

    Inputs:
        - **n** (int) - The number of rows of returned tensor. Constant value only.
        - **m** (int) - The number of columns of returned tensor. Constant value only.
        - **t** (mindspore.dtype) - MindSpore's dtype, the data type of the returned tensor.
          Default: ``None`` , the data type of the returned tensor is mindspore.float32.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, a tensor with ones on the diagonal and the rest of elements are zero. The shape of `output` depends on
        the user's Inputs `n` and `m`. And the data type depends on Inputs `t`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import ops
        >>> eye = ops.Eye()
        >>> output = eye(2, 2, mindspore.int32)
        >>> print(output)
        [[1 0]
         [0 1]]
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Int32
        >>> output = eye(1, 2, mindspore.float64)
        >>> print(output)
        [[1. 0.]]
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Float64
