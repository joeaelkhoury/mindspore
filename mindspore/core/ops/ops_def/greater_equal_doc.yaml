greater_equal:
    description: |
        Given two Tensors, compares them element-wise to check if each element in the first
        Tensor is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in the second Tensor.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.ge` for more details.

        Args:
            - **x** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) - The first input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
            - **y** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) - The second input is a number or
            a bool when the first input is a tensor or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> greater_equal = ops.greater_equal()
            >>> output = greater_equal(x, y)
            >>> print(output)
            [True True False]
