less_equal:
  description: |
    Computes the boolean value of :math:`x <= y` element-wise.

    Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.le` for more details.

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The first input is a number.Number or
        a bool or a tensor whose data type is
        `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
        `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
        - **y** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The second input, when the first input is a Tensor,
        the second input should be a number.Number or bool value, or a Tensor whose data type is number or bool\_.
        When the first input is Scalar, the second input must be a Tensor whose data type is number or bool\_.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = ops.less_equal(x, y)
        >>> print(output)
        [ True False  True]
