    Computes the boolean value of :math:`input < other` element-wise.

    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The first input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
        other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The second input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,and the data type is bool.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` and `other` is not one of the following: Tensor, Number, bool.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = ops.less(input, other)
        >>> print(output)
        [False False True]
