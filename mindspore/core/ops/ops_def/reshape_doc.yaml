reshape:
    description: |
        Rearranges the input Tensor based on the given shape.

        The 'shape' can only have one -1 at most, in which case it's inferred from the remaining dimensions and
        the number of elements in the input.
        
        Args:
            input (Tensor): The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
            shape (Union[tuple[int], Tensor[int]]): Constructed by multiple
                integers, i.e., :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`. Only constant value is allowed.
        
        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape of tensor is :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`.
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: Given a shape tuple, if it has several -1; or if the product
                of its elements is less than or equal to 0 or cannot be divided by the product
                of the input tensor shape; or if it does not match the input's array size.

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([[-0.1, 0.3, 3.6], [0.4, 0.5, -3.2]]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.reshape(input, (3, 2))
            >>> print(output)
            [[-0.1  0.3]
             [ 3.6  0.4]
             [ 0.5 -3.2]]
