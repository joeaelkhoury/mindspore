diag:
    description: |
        Constructs a diagonal tensor with a given diagonal values.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.diag` for more details.

        Args:
            - **input_x** (Tensor) - The input tensor.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same dtype as the `input_x`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input_x = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]).astype('int32')
            >>> output = ops.diag(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1 0 0 0]
             [0 2 0 0]
             [0 0 3 0]
             [0 0 0 4]]
